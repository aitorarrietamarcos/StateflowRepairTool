*Conditional Operator Replacement (R):
*Mathematical Operator Replacement (R):
*Change of unit in the after (R):
*Numerical Replacement Operator in Transition (R):
*Numerical Replacement Operator in State (R):
*Transition Destination Replacement (R):
*Transition Root Replacement (R):
*Initial Transition Change (R):
*Action State Replacment (R):
*Variable Insertion In State (I):
