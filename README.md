# StateflowRepairTool

This repository is a research-purpose repository aiming at researching methods to repair stateflow models. 

## Status

The current status is preliminary. A set of mutation operators are being implemented in the form of Insertion (I), Replace (R) or Delete (D) actions. These are implemented inside the Miscellanous folder and encompass the following operators:

### Relational Operator Replacement (R)
It replaces relational operators in a transition (e.g., <= to ==)

### Conditional Operator Replacement (R)
It replaces conditional operators in a transitions (e.g., && to ||)

### Mathematical Operator Replacement (R)
It replaces mathematical operators in a transition or state (e.g., + to -)

### Change of unit in the after (R)
It replaces the unit in an after function in a transition (e.g., from msec to sec)

### Numerical Replacement Operator in Transition (R)
It replaces numerical values in transition (e.g., from 5 to 1)

### Numerical Replacement Operator in State (R)
It replaces numerical values in states (e.g., from 5 to 1)

### Transition Destination Replacement (R)
It changes the destination state of a transition

### Transition Root Replacement (R)
It changes the root state of a transition

### Initial Transition Change (R)
It changes the initial transition from state

### Action State Replacment (R) (Not implemented?)

### Delete State (D)
It delates a state from the stateflow chart.

### Delete Transition (D)
It delates a transition from the stateflow chart.

### Delete Variable from a State (D)
It delates a variable from a state.

### Delete Condition from a Transition (D)
It delates a condition from a transition (e.g., A==5 && B<3 -> A==5).

### Insert Mathematical Operator (I)
It inserts a mathematical operator in a state

### Variable Insertion In State (I)
It inserts a new variable in a state

### Insert New Condition (I)
It inserts a new condition in a transition (e.g., from A==5 -> A==5 && B>=8)

## Current identified problems:

* The mutator generates some times after(0,sec), which is non-compilable.
